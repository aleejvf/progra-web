    <p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and disli
        ke men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of
         the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trou
         ble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in thei
         r duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking fro
         m toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free
          hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being abl
          e to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But i
          n certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it w
          ill frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise ma
          n therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
           secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
